# Parchi


> Project Description
Parchi is a paperless electronic document used for ticketing which can help in better crowd management of museums/heritage sites using a QR based ticketing system with necessary hardware for a seamless visiting experience in Museums and heritage sites. In addition, the prediction of the expected crowd is added as a feature. 
It reduces booking expenses by eliminating the need for printing and mailing paper documents and can help in keeping a better record of visitors. Also, it may improve sales as a visitor can book, purchase and print out the electronic ticket at any time of the day as and when needed.
